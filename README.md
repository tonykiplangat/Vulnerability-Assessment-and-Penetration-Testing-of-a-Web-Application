# Vulnerability-Assessment-and-Penetration-Testing-of-a-Web-Application
## Project Overview
This project involves conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on a deliberately vulnerable web application, OWASP Juice Shop. The goal is to identify security vulnerabilities and demonstrate the exploitation process to understand how attackers might compromise a web application.

## Objectives
- Identify Vulnerabilities: Use various tools and techniques to discover potential security flaws in the application.
- Demonstrate Exploitation: Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate their impact.
- Provide Recommendations: Document findings and suggest remediation strategies to improve the applicationâ€™s security posture.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux: A Linux distribution specifically designed for penetration testing and security auditing.
- Nmap: A network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
- Nikto: A web server scanner that detects vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Burp Suite: An integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications, allowing for manual and automated testing.
- Metasploit: A penetration testing framework that helps in developing and executing exploit code against a remote target.
